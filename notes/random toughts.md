- memory explicit: user authors patterns, mapping to memory heap/stack works orthogonal, integration with gpu?
    - program language typically assumes stack exists -> bad mapping to GPU
    - mem: stack: linear memory alloc, heap: random allocator
    - register: fixed size, no addr


- explicit call to apply rules to block
- differ between action and rules - how to author them?

- user declareable operators
    - rewrite and 'lift' operations
