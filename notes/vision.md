- realtime collaboration (small team, trust, automatic) and async collaboration (review, curated) [[version control]]
- tools, dev environmnet part of a project under same version control and care as the product code [[version control]]
- programming language built around tooling and editing
- pattern based programming, multi-stage
- compiler as components, linking etc part of project code allow easily deviate from default path
- matcher algorithm/pattern set applied to function, not global pattern registry

### Motivation
- Mathematica/Matlab: visualization and exploration of data/code central to product development
- Omniverse/USD: collaboration of different teams, support of 'layers' to allow seamless interop,
- MLIR: extensible compiler with custom operations and optimizations, but aim to stay in language (not C++)
