**Thoughts**
Data structure (Graph) will be the foundation of the compiler. Built with easy composition and manipulation in mind to stay flexible and minimal. Trust and confidence in the operations applied on the graph is key to scale to more complex solutions allowing to seamlessly interact with different parts of thr graph.

Key Concepts:
- Authoring and Layering (generate data, graph manipulation, extending ops and rules)
- Collaboration and Versioning (temporal, keep track of changes, merges)
- Expanding and Completing (automatic rewrite, exploration within rules, incremental)
- Visualization and Filtering (slicing data e.g temporal, layers, expansion)
